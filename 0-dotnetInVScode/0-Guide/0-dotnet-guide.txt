for building a dotnet app in vscode:

1. we should build a solution first

2. then build our app

sample: console app=>
 - command 1 : dotnet new sln --name "the name of the solution"
 - command 2 : dotnet new console --output "the name of app"
 - command 3 : dotnet sln add "the name of app"

 To build different types of .NET projects in Visual Studio Code, 
 you can use various commands provided by the .NET CLI and C# Dev Kit extension. 
 Here is a list of essential commands for building .NET projects:

1. **dotnet build**: This command builds a project or solution.
2. **dotnet clean**: Cleans all solution outputs.
3. **dotnet run**: Runs the application from source.
4. **dotnet restore**: Restores the dependencies for an application.
5. **dotnet publish**: Publishes a .NET framework-dependent or self-contained application.

These commands are essential for managing and building your .NET projects efficiently 
in Visual Studio Code.

Ok, to create different types of .NET applications using Visual Studio Code,
you can use the `dotnet new` command with specific templates. 
The following are some common templates that you can use to generate different types of 
.NET applications:

1. **Console Application (console)**: Creates a basic console application.
2. **Web API (webapi)**: Generates a web API project.
3. **Blazor WebAssembly App (blazorwasm)**: Produces a Blazor WebAssembly app.
4. **MVC WebApp (mvc)**: Creates a MVC web application.
5. **Class Library (classlib)**: Builds a class library.
6. **Unit Test Project (xunit)**: Generates a unit test project.
7. **ASP.NET Core Empty (empty)**: Creates an empty ASP.NET Core project.
8. **Razor Class Library (razor)**: Produces a Razor class library.
9. **Static Website (static)**: Generates a static website.
10. **Workflow Console App (workflow)**: Creates a workflow console application.

You can specify the output directory when creating these applications using the `--output` flag followed by the desired folder path. For example, if you want to create a Blazor WebAssembly app named 'MyProject' in the 'C:\projects\myproject\' directory, you would use the following command:

```bash
dotnet new blazorwasm -o C:\projects\myproject\MyProject
```

This will create a new Blazor WebAssembly app named 'MyProject' in the specified directory.

note: see this =>
dotnet new console -o AboutMyEnvironment --use-program-main
=> this bitch "--use-program-main" will disable top-level-statement
